# 🐱🐶 Cat-Dog Image Classification

A deep learning project that classifies images as either Cat or Dog using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
This project demonstrates end-to-end image classification, from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and prediction.

# 📌 Features

Classifies images into Cat or Dog categories.

Built using TensorFlow/Keras CNN architecture.

Includes data preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation).

Achieves high accuracy on the test dataset.

Supports custom image prediction.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib, Seaborn

OpenCV (for image handling)


# 📊 Model Architecture

Input Layer → Image size (e.g., 128x128x3)

Conv2D + MaxPooling layers (multiple)
